# Chlorhexidine-survival-analysis
“Capstone project – Survival Analysis of Chlorhexidine RCT data using Python”
By- Dr Insiya Munavver


Project Overview

This project performs a complete survival analysis on data from a randomized controlled trial (RCT) comparing two concentrations of chlorhexidine mouth care (0.12% vs. 0.20%) for the prevention of Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia (VAP) among ICU patients.

The analysis focuses on evaluating:

Time-to-event outcomes

VAP-free survival probabilities

Differences between treatment groups

Clinical and statistical significance of predictors

The project uses Python (via lifelines, pandas, seaborn, matplotlib) to conduct rigorous survival modelling.

🎯 Objectives:-
Perform data preprocessing
Conduct Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Estimate Survival Curves
Compare groups using statistical tests
Fit a multivariable Cox Proportional Hazards (Cox-PH) Model


🛠 Tech Stack & Tools
Python 3

lifelines – survival modelling (KM, Cox, log-rank)

pandas – data cleaning and manipulation

numpy – array operations

matplotlib, seaborn – visualization

openpyxl – Excel file handling

Jupyter Notebook – interactive analysis


📝 Academic & Clinical Relevance

This project demonstrates how survival analysis can answer clinically meaningful questions such as:

Does chlorhexidine concentration influence the timing or risk of developing VAP?

How rapidly do patients develop VAP during ICU stay?

Which clinical characteristics predict VAP occurrence?

The methodology reflects standard analytical approaches used in critical care research and epidemiology.
